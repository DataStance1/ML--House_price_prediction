**Machine learning model development for accurate house price prediction using multiple regression techniques**
-
In this analysis, I explored the housing dataset to predict SalePrice. The initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed that GrLivArea was a strong linear predictor. A simple linear regression model using only this feature established a baseline performance with an R-squared of approximately 0.56. To explore improvements, two advanced techniques were tested. A Random Forest Regressor was applied to the same GrLivArea feature, which improved the R-squared to 0.63 by capturing non-linear patterns that the linear model missed. The most significant improvement, however, came from using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By combining four highly correlated features (OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, and TotalBsmtSF) into two principal components, we created powerful new features that encapsulated over 74% of the original data's variance. A linear regression model trained on these two components achieved a superior R-squared of 0.70 and a significantly lower Mean Absolute Error. This project clearly demonstrates that while more complex algorithms can offer an uplift, thoughtful feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to combine multiple sources of information are often the most effective strategies for dramatically improving a model's predictive power.
